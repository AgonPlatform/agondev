### Example of Playing Simple Sounds

Play with keys:

  1) 'bell' sound
  2) sinewave tone
  3) white noise while key pressed
  4) sampled sound from memory
  5) sampled sound from a local file
  6) sound with volume envelope by key press

In order to load a raw sound file from a local file, we need to know its length. This could be done manually, but in this example a small library call is made to find the size.

Press ESC to exit the program.
